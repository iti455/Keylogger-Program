⚙️ How It Works
This keylogger uses the pynput Python library to:
-Monitor and capture every keystroke.
-Convert the keystrokes into readable text.
-Save the sequence of keys pressed into log.txt.

🛠️ Requirements
Make sure to install the required module using pip:
pip install pynput

▶️ Running the Program
Run the script from your terminal or any Python IDE:
python keylogger.py

As you type, keys will be recorded in the log.txt file.
⚠️ Note: Keyloggers can be sensitive tools. This script is for educational purposes only. Do not use it unethically or without consent.
